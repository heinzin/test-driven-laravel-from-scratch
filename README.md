What I personally love about TDD is that it gives you some hints what to do next after every failed test run.
If you're a busy developer, like me, you have to switch between languages, frameworks, IDEs and operating systems and it's hard to 
remember all the code you have to write to make a working app at the first try. Using TDD, the only thing I have to remember is how to run the tests, isn't it wonderful?! The test are better than any docs or how-tos, they quickly put you into the right mindset.
I cannot recommend highly enough using TDD or at least some tests in you day to day work. You will be more productive and more confident in your code, you will go faster! Just believe me or [Uncle Bob](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2013/03/11/TheFrenziedPanicOfRushing.html):-)
